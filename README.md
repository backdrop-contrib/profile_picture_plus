TODO: does backdrop have imagemagick support?
If you have php 5.5 if you will need either the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/imagemagick" title="ImageMagick">ImageMagick</a> processing toolkit or you will need to apply a very small patch to core. 

TODO: convert drupal 7 patch to backdrop
See https://www.drupal.org/node/2215369, patch from #35 works. This issue will go away once that patch is committed to core.
