======================

Installation
------------

  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

Description
-----------

Currently, this module does 2 things:

<ul>
  <li>allows you to correct the orientation of your user profile picture.</li>
  <li>removes the picture upload element when the user profile picture has already been uploaded</li>
</ul>

more features to come...

This module works fine with php5.5 if you are using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/imagemagick" title="ImageMagick">ImageMagick</a> processing toolkit.
For php5.5 with the default gd image library you will need to apply a very small patch to core, see https://www.drupal.org/node/2215369, patch from #35 works. This issue will go away once that patch is committed to core.
